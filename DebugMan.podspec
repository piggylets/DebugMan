                    DebugMan is an debugger tool for iOS in Swift, released under the MIT License. The author stole the idea from remirobert/Dotzu and JxbSir/JxbDebugTool so that people can make crappy clones.

                    DebugMan has the following features:

                    ● display all app logs in different colors as you like.
                    ● display all app network http requests details, including third-party SDK in app.
                    ● display app device informations and app identity informations.
                    ● display app crash logs.
                    ● filter keywords in app logs and app network http requests.
                    ● app memory real-time monitoring.
